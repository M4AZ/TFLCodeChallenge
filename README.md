# TFLCodeChallenge

A simple .NET Core 6.0 console app that displays the status of a given road.

The solution has three main project
  1.  REST Client Class library Project
  2.  Console App Project
  3.  Xunit Test Project 
  
  
## Rest Client Class library Project

This project contains a thin abstraction over the TFL API, which is injected to console app via .NET's built-in DI, 
This is to maintain seperation of concerns and to make the enitre project unit testing friendly.


## Console App Project

.NET CORE console application, fully DI compatible, and easily TDD-capable.

## Xunit Test Project 

A simple Xunit test project with mock TFL client and test cases. 


## FAQ

### How to build the code?

Any assumptions that youâ€™ve made

* The problem statement is well-defined and free of ambiguities.
* The input to the program is valid and follows the expected format.
* The program does not need to handle errors or edge cases that are not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.
* The program does not need to be optimized for performance or memory usage, unless explicitly stated in the problem statement.
* The program does not need to handle concurrency or multi-threading unless explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.
* The developer has access to all necessary libraries and dependencies to solve the problem efficiently.
* The developer is free to choose any testing framework to solve the problem.
* The program does not need to handle security vulnerabilities or prevent against malicious input.
* Authentication, Logging, Server side caching and other production server configurations is an integral part of an application however for the sake of time it is not included.

## Some Important Noted
* App Settings is included in the project to include API related settings, however while I have regeisted on the
